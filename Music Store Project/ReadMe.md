Welcome to the Music Store Analysis Project!

This project is based on a fictional music store's sales dataset, designed to showcase my SQL skills. 
The dataset is highly normalized and consists of 11 tables, covering various aspects of the business such as customers, invoices, tracks, and artists.

Throughout this project, I aim to answer several business-related questions using SQL. 
For each question, I have provided a technical explanation of how I arrived at the solution, with the SQL queries included right after each explanation.

This analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL, leveraging various SQL techniques such as joins, aggregate functions, window functions, and CTEs.

These questions address key business insights that a real-world music company would find valuable.
